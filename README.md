# rPi-xmrig-gcc7.3.0
## The fastest miner available for Raspbian.

This miner is a compilation of https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig, compiled with gcc/g++ 7.3.0 specifically for Raspbian Jessie on Raspberry Pi3 b (untested on earlier models - but please feel free to try and post your findings). As noted in the Ubuntu build instructions on the official xmrig repo: "Optionally you can use gcc 7 to small performance increase" (https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/wiki/Ubuntu-Build). Additionally, a recent change may take further advantage of 7.3.0 over 7.1.0, discussed here: https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/pull/385
